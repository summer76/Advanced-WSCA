# Advanced-WSCA
Advanced weighted-spectral clustering algorithm (AWSCA)

Description:
	Python implementations of the Advanced weighted-spectral clustering algorithm. Relies on networkx for a lot of the heavy lifting.
	The community structure is a common non-trivial topological feature of many complex real-world networks. AWSCA is capable of detecting the community structure of a network with no prior knowledge of the cluster number. 
	
Usage:
	python main.py test.csv
